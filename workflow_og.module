/**
 * Implementation of hook_menu().
 *
 * hook_menu() must be implemented to emit items to place in the main menu.
 * This is a required step for modules wishing to display their own pages,
 * because the process of creating the links also tells Drupal what
 * callback function to use for a given URL. The menu items returned
 * here provide this information to the menu system.
 *
 * With the below menu definitions, URLs will be interpreted as follows:
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=example/foo, then the menu system
 * will first look for a menu item with that path. In this case it will
 * find a match, and execute workflow_og_foo().
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=example, no match will be found,
 * and a 404 page will be displayed. They same will happen for the urls:
 *  - http://example.com/?q=example/baz
 *  - http://example.com/?q=example/baz/1
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=example/baz, the menu system
 * will not find a match, as the menu entries are registered with the form:
 * a/b/c/d. All the elements included in the menu entry definition should be
 * present for the menu system to match the request.
 *
 * If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=example/baz/1/2, the menu system
 * will first look for example/baz/1/2. Not finding a match, it will look for
 * example/baz/1/%. Again not finding a match, it will look for example/baz/%/2. Yet
 * again not finding a match, it will look for example/baz/%/%. This time it finds
 * a match, and so will execute workflow_og_baz(1, 2). Note the parameters
 * being passed; this is a very useful technique.
 *
 * The @link menu_example.module Menu Example @endlink provides extensive
 * examples for hook_menu().
